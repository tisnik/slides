One of the drawbacks of Python is that applications run relatively slowly written in this language. However, nowadays the situation is not bad at all, because there are both JIT (Just In Time) and AOT (Ahead of Time) Python compilers. What's more, the classic CPython is constantly being improved, with a relatively big performance leap taking place with Python version 3.11. There is also a variant of CPython without Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). In this lecture, we will introduce Numba (JIT), mypyc (AOT) and Python technologies without GIL.
