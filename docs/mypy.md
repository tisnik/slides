   - web browser (simple actions)

* Lot of unit tests needs to be written
* Information about types are sometimes "hidden" in comments

---

## Static types as optional language feature

```
Language       Static types provided by

JavaScript     TypeScript, Flow

Ruby           Sorbet
```

## Python

* Dynamically typed language
   - no plans to change that!
* Type annotations are fully optional
* Mypy or Pyright are static checkers
