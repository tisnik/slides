# ML programming lanugage family

## ML language

* functional
* polymorphic Hindleyâ€“Milner type system
    - type inference
    - no runtime type errors (proof)
* pattern matching
* one of the few languages to be
    - completely specified
    - and verified using formal semantics

---

## ML language family

* ML (Meta Language)
* SML (Standard ML)
* CAML (Categorical Abstract Machine Language)
* OCaml (Objective CAML)
* F#

---

## ML functional

* Functions are first-class citizens
* Pure functions (w/o side effects)
* Immutable values are preffered
    - purely functional data structures
